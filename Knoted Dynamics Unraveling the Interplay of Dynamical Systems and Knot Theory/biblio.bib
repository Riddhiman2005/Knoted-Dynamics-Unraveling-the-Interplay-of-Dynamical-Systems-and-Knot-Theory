@article{chaoticknots,
abstract = {The delicate interplay between knot theory and dynamical systems is surveyed. Numerous bridges between these fields allow us to apply dynamical perspectives (entropy, ‘chaotic’) to knot theory, as well as knot-theoretic perspectives (cablings, ‘wild’) to dynamical phenomena and bifurcations thereof. This intricate relationship has opened new doors in the study of ODE models of physical systems, while conversely yielding interesting topological objects from dynamical flows},
